## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - React Lib for styles

### What I learned

This project was one of the most challenging projects Iâ€™ve undertaken. It helped me significantly in developing my skills with Styled Components and React, and it provided valuable insights into different ways of using Styled Components. Additionally, this project taught me how to work with regular expressions and perform form validation.

### Continued development

I believe the aspects I need to focus on for improvement are related to regular expression usage and code organization. I noticed that my code became quite verbose.
